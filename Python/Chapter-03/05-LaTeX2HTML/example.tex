The sum of the squares of the first $n$ natural numbers is given as:
$$ \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} i^{2} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot n \cdot (n+1) \cdot (2\cdot n + 1). $$
According to Pythagoras, the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is
the square root of the squares of the length of the two catheti:
$$ c = \sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}}.  $$
The area of a circle is given as 
$$  A = \pi \cdot r^{2},   $$ 
while its circumference satisfies
$$ C = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot r.  $$
